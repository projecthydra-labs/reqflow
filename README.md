# Reqflow

Simple, self-aware, requirements based workflow manager based on Redis/Resque.

Reqflow lets you define workflows based on actions that define their own 
prerequisites. Actions whose prerequisites are met can be queued in parallel 
with one another.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'reqflow'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:
