# reqflow

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/projecthydra-labs/reqflow.png)](http://travis-ci.org/projecthydra-labs/reqflow)

Simple, self-aware, requirements based workflow manager based on Redis/Resque.

Reqflow lets you define workflows based on actions that define their own 
prerequisites. Actions whose prerequisites are met can be queued in parallel 
with one another.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'reqflow'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install reqflow

## Usage

Please refer to `spec/config/workflows/spec_workflow.yml` and `spec/impl/spec_workflow.rb`
for examples of how to define and configure a workflow implementation.
